# React Memo Example

This repository contains an example demonstrating the use of `React.memo` in React. `React.memo` is a higher-order component that optimizes performance by memoizing functional components and preventing unnecessary re-renders when props do not change.

## Project Structure
The project includes two scripts to compare the behavior of a component with and without `React.memo`:
1. `script1.js`: Basic component implementation without `React.memo`.
2. `script2.js`: Enhanced component implementation using `React.memo`.

### File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file to load the React app.
- `script1.js`: Contains the basic implementation without memoization.
- `script2.js`: Contains the optimized implementation with `React.memo`.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Laxshan19/react-memo-example.git
